# Aragon JS SDK Client common utilities

`@aragon/sdk-client-common` provides a set of base classes for creating custom
JS clients on top of the built-in one.

- Extendable JS client with built-in Web3, Subgraph and IPFS
- Extendable context for holding inheritable configuration

# Installation

Use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install
@aragon/sdk-client-common.

```bash
npm install @aragon/sdk-client-common
yarn add @aragon/sdk-client-common
```

# Usage

The SDK usage is demonstrated in the
[SDK examples section of the Developer Portal](https://devs.aragon.org/docs/sdk/examples/).

## React Native

In order for the SDK to be used in restricted environments like react native
install the following polyfilesand into your project:

- [@ethersproject/shims](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@ethersproject/shims)
- [react-native-url-polyfill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-url-polyfill)

Then import them like the following **before** you import the Aragon SDK
package:

```javascript
import "@ethersproject/shims";
import "react-native-url-polyfill/auto";
import { Client } from "@aragon/sdk-client-common";
```

## Low level networking

See `ClientCore` ([source](./src/internal/core.ts)):

- Abstract class implementing primitives for:
  - Web3, contracts, signing
  - IPFS
  - GraphQL
- Inherited by classes like `Client` and all plugin classes like
  `TokenVotingClient`.

## Common interfaces, types, enum's

When updating the `ClientCore` class:

- **Update first** all affected enum's, types and interfaces in
  `src/internal/interfaces.ts`

# Testing

To execute library tests just run:

```bash
yarn test
```
